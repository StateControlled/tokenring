Server Initialization
The Server reads in a list of Events on sale from disk then starts a Master actor and passes the list to them
The Master actor creates the nodes of the token ring, connects them together, then distributes chunks of tickets to each.
It holds and unallocated chunks in reserve.
Each node (kiosk) holds a reference to its neighbor in the ring and to the Master actor.

Ask
A client will connect to a kiosk to purchase a ticket for an event.
A client will use an Ask pattern for critical communications, such as ticket purchasing, to send a query to a kiosk and
then wait for a response. After a certain amount of time, the operation will time out and fail. The client will then
select another kiosk to connect to so the next attempt may succeed.

Fault tolerance
Cluster system allows nodes to join and leave the system in an orderly manner and a one-for-one supervisor strategy
allows the Master to restart failed nodes.
Weakness: If the Master crashes, the whole system may go down.
